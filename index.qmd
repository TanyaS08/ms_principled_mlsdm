## SDMs are an ML problem

- probabilistic classifiers
- optimal threshold for rangemap
- see Beery for the same argument aimed at ML prac
- can do ML even without doing DL
- lots of practices from ML already, we suggest a broader guideline for what/how to adopt
- in each section, introduce SDM concepts and map to ML vocabulary
- conclude each section on recommendations + nuance: when departing from ML best prac is acceptable

## Exploratory data analysis and the risk of data leakage

- data transformation issues + can lead to leakage
- overview of data transformation practices in the literature
- problem when changing the scale of prediction

## Imbalanced classification and the generation of background points

- classification: balance v. imbalance
- accuracy paradox + colinearity + issues with the status of negatives
- review recommendations about number of background points -- lead to classification extremely unbalanced

## Cross-validation and model evaluation

- elements from Becker et al. on how to validate with positive only
- review different folding techniques
- unambiguous recommendation about MCC over everything else
- BUT examples with different acceptable biases for different uses

## Hyper-parameters and self-tuning models

- show example of learning the threshold (can even be done with BIOCLIM)
- how to tune many parameters at once?
- overview of tech solutions, *e.g.* wrapping models in a tuning model

## Interpretability of predictions

- Shapley values + LIME
- overview of literature on policy based on ML
- framework: MTL declaration
- examples of mapping -- see the here be dragons paper

## Enabling what-if scenarios for predictive models

- counterfactuals theory
- example of guiding actions: how can we flip a prediction
- types of model that support this

## Perspective: what SDM can contribute

- JSDM
- nested models 1 (tick require deer require vegetation)
- nested models 2 (abundance require presence)

## Conclusions
